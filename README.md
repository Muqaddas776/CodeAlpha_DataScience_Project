# CodeAlpha_DataScience_Project

This repository contains three different Data Science projects that demonstrate various techniques and algorithms for predictive modeling. The projects include:
1. Titanic Classification
2. Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
3. Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

## 1. Titanic Classification
This project uses historical data from the Titanic disaster to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger would have survived. The key features considered are socio-economic status, age, gender, and other factors.

### Key Steps:
1. Data Cleaning and Exploration
2. Feature Engineering
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Training with Random Forest
5. Model Evaluation
6. Analysis of Feature Importance


## 2. Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the stock price of a given company. I have  use historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance to train the model.

### Key Steps:
1. Data Collection using Yahoo Finance API
2. Data Preprocessing and Scaling
3. Creating Sequences for LSTM
4. Train-Test Split
5. Building and Training the LSTM Model
6. Model Evaluation and Visualization


## 3. Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression
This project builds a linear regression model to predict a numerical outcome based on one or more features. I have use the Boston Housing dataset for this task.

### Key Steps:
1. Data Exploration and Visualization
2. Train-Test Split
3. Building the Linear Regression Model
4. Model Evaluation
5. Visualization of Predictions and Residuals
6. Analysis of Feature Importance


## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Scikit-learn
7. TensorFlow / Keras
8. Yahoo Finance API

## Usage
Navigate to the respective project directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the code and results.
